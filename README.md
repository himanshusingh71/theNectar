# Perfume Online Store #

This repository contains the source code for a simple website that I created using HTML and CSS
The website is a mock up for a perfume online store.
It consists of the following:
* A navigation page
* Order Button
* An about section
* A services section
* A product section
* A footer section
It is a basic website, but it is a good example of how I use HTML and CSS to create a simple and visually appealing website.
